<p style="font-family:comic sans ms;">This webpage displays  two Infographics about Underage drinking habits and statistics found on google. These Inforgraphics have been studied and analyzed carefully to create a visualization Wheel using inkscape to represent the comparison. Further, an in-depth analysis has been carried out to point out the positive and the negatove points of the infographics found.  <br>
    All the findings are presented below <br>
<br>
    <font color="darkpink">Here are the images and links to the websites from where these Infographics are fetched : </font><br>

    </p>

<ul>
    <li style="font-family:comic sans ms;"> What the Infographics do well :
        <ol>
            <li style="font-family:comic sans ms;"> The data is well quantified, shows numbers and exact values which helps in better understanding of the infographic and gives a clear idea of the situation.
                <li> The information is well depicted with enough decoration and the infographic is colorful and attractive which adds interest in reading it.
                    <li> The values and the data seem familiar with the real world conditions as heard in news media.
                        <li> The infographic succeeds in conveying the message (harm of underage drinking).
                        <li> The statistics provided in the infographic are enough to make conclusions.
                        </ul>
<ul>
    <li style="font-family:comic sans ms;"> What could be improved :
            <ol>
                <li style="font-family:comic sans ms;"> More data and information would make the infpgraphic much better and efficient.
                    <li> The data is somehow redundant which is why the total amount of information is lesser than it could actually have been.
                    </li> The infographics could have had more dimensions.
                    <li> The infographics could have been more attractive and colorful to attract readers better.
                        <li> There could have been more dimensions which would add more functionality to the infographics.
